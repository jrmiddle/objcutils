objcutils
=========

Shims and Jigs I've found helpful in the objective-c world.

* NSArray+ArrayUtils:  category on NSArray which allows for
  transmuting/filtering objects from one NSArray into another (for when
  you want to produce an entire array, rather than iterating).

* NSArray+StringUtils:  category on NSString which adds some NSArray
  and NSDictionary conversion routines and an easy md5 hash function.
